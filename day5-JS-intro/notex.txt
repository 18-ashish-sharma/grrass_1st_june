JAVASCRIPT:

print something -> console.log(something);
Variables -> we can define in three ways.

something is a variable here.
console.log(something) -> it will print something.

Types of variables: string(text), number , boolean, array, object.

String: text -> should be in '' or ""
Boolean: true, false
Array: group of values -> anything can be included.
Object: key value pairs. (dictionary, JSON)

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. read('https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp'). file extension -> .json

1) var -> 
2) let ->
3) const -> 

Functions -> syntax -> function <name> () {write your code here}
             calling function -> syntax -> <name>()

             function(a,b) -> a,b are called props.


Functions types:
                1 - syncronous function. (no waiting)
                2 - asynchronous function. (wait)
